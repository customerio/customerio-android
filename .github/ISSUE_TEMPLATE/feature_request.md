<!-- summary of what this task is. Sum it up in a sentence of two. We are giving our customers the ability to do ____ --->

# Why are we doing this for our customers? 

<!-- Why are we deciding to do this? What are our customers doing today and how is this better? What is the problem that this is solving? -->

# How do we test that this change is successful? 

<!-- How does the implementation engineer know that this task is done? How does QA know what the end goals are in order to test that the task can get done? -->

# How are we building this? 

<!-- The geeky stuff. The tech. Bullet point list of the steps to take to get this done. Write it in a way that an implementation engineer on the team can take this issue, do the work, and the work looks similar to whatever everyone on the team is thinking. List helps to keep us all on the same page with how we think this should be built. -->

<!-- 
...before you create the issue, ask yourself these questions.....

- [ ] Does QA understand what we are doing here? What the goal is? 
- [ ] Does product understand why we are doing this? What this is ultimately doing for us and our customer? 
- [ ] If someone was to leave work for 3 months and come back, could they look at our project board and understand what is going on? 
- [ ] If you were to give this task to another engineering to do, could they be on the same page with you on how to implement this?
