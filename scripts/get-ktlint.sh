# Script to install ktlint CLI binary to use for lint checking. 
# This script is used to install a specific version of the CLI as specified in the script. This makes sure that 
# everyone on the team *and* the CI server are all using the same version. 
# 
# Releases of ktlint are not backwards compatible. We have found that when a new version is released, our lint 
# commands on the CI server break and we need to fix it. This prevents that by having everyone on the same version
# and we can be assured that all old and future builds will always compile (because we have a strict ktlint version set). 

# if debugging this script, use "set -ex"
