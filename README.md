Thank you for your interest in wanting to contribute to the project! Let's get your development environment setup so you can get developing.

1. Clone the project.
2. Import the project into Android Studio.
3. Android Studio should walk you through installing the correct SDK. If all went well, you should be able to build the Example app within Android Studio. This is a good sign you're setup correctly.
4. Setup git hooks to lint your code for you:

```
$ ./hooks/autohook.sh install
[Autohook] Scripts installed into .git/hooks
```
