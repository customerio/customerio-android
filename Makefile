# Command designed to run on CI server to check if lint was run before pushing code to the repo. 
# This is because the CI server is not meant to commit code so we don't want to format code on the CI 
# server in case files get modified from formatting. 
# 
# This comand runs ktlint to try and find lint errors. If any are found an error message is shown and then the command fails which will 
# trigger the CI server to show an error for linting. 
# If there are no lint errors, the command will succeed and not show any error messages.

# Run ktlint formatter to automatically fix many lint errors. Good to run this before checking for lint errors as this formatting might fix many issues. 
format:

# Designed for manually running linter on your computer during development. 
# format first, and then show lint errors that are left over.
